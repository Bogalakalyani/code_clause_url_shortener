# url_shortener

This is a Python-based GUI application that uses the pyshorteners module to shorten URLs. To run this application, you need to have Python 3.x and the following Python modules installed: pyshorteners, tkinter, and clipboard. These modules can be installed using pip.

To use the application, clone or download the repository and navigate to the directory containing the url_shortener.py file. Run the Python script with the command python url_shortener.py. The application window will open, and you can enter the URL you want to shorten in the input field.

Click the "Shorten URL" button to generate a shortened URL. If the URL is successfully generated, it will be displayed on the screen. You can click the "Click me! if you want to copy url to your clipboard" button to copy the shortened URL to your clipboard.

If an error occurs while generating the shortened URL, such as an invalid URL or an error with the pyshorteners module, an error message will be displayed on the screen. The application uses an except block to catch any exceptions that occur during URL shortening and display an error message.

If you have any suggestions for improvements or new features to add to this application, feel free to submit a pull request.
